# ECE110RobotProject
Project code from ECE110 Fall 2019. 

This project consisted of 5 teams of 2 working on 5 bots. Each of the 5 bots on the team had to accurately display the obtainedmnumbers (1â€“5) from each of the other members of the team. To do so, each Bot must obtain its own numerical value from its given task on the Mission and then communicate that value to its teammates.
